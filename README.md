# Next.js Link Component Navigation Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the Next.js Link component for client-side navigation. The Link component appears to be set up correctly, but navigation to the `/about` page fails silently.  This example shows the problem and its solution.

## Problem

The provided code includes a basic Next.js application with a Home page that links to an About page.  However, clicking the link does not navigate to the About page as expected.  No error messages are displayed in the console. This issue arises when Next.js's routing mechanisms are not properly configured or interfere with the intended behavior.
